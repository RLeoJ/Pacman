there are a max of 4 move options at any moment. on a dice roll, the ghost will chose to either move to the block closer to pacman or away depending on the ghost. (must know how to determine which block is closer)
-loop through adjacent spaces to check for empty space. char CheckSpaces() { return availablespaces[]}
-determine if ghost wants to move closer or further from pacman. bool moveDecision{ return movedecision that is either closer or farther}
- send movedecision to newposition to update position

ghost and pacman must update on tick. 

death: if food is eaten, a ghost dies, or pacman dies, they must be removed from the array.

if pacman is in a space on the grid, 
	if its food, remove food from grid
	if its ghost && pacman has superfood, remove ghost from grid
		else if its ghost && pacman doesnt have superfood, remove pacman from grid and trigger gameover

pill system
starts a timer
while timer i > 0, ghost behavior is to always move away


ghost movement
decide of ghost wants to move closer or farther
if farther
	for each adjacent tile, 
		if tile is farther than all other options //this must be split into an if and 3 more elseif's
			move to that tile
if closer
	for each adjacent tile, 
		if tile is closer than all other options //this must be split into an if and 3 more elseif's
			move to that tile
