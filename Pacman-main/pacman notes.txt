grid system
Designated as enums (path,wall,teleporter)
	x tiles are impassable
	o tiles get a bool for dot


points system
takes the array of o tiles and adds a new point whenever bool is flipped
handles win condition for if all bools are flipped

move system
handles move direction
player move system works with input system
ghost move system works with rng behavior system

ghost system
base ghost class decision chances
	each ghost is just a child of base ghost with different decision values
bool for if pill is triggered

there are a max of 4 move options at any moment. on a dice roll, the ghost will chose to either move to the block closer to pacman or away depending on the ghost. (must know how to determine which block is closer)
-loop through adjacent spaces to check for empty space. char CheckSpaces() { return availablespaces[]}
-determine if ghost wants to move closer or further from pacman. bool moveDecision{ return movedecision that is either closer or farther}
- send movedecision to newposition to update position


pill system
starts a timer
while timer i > 0, ghost behavior is to always move away

glposision = projmatrix*viewmatrix*modelmatrix*position

moving the cube is updating the matrix of cube and feeding that new data to the shader (letting the GPU do this will be more efficient)
the most important thing about building pacman is understanding how to feed unformation to the GPU


set data layout
use shader that takes uniforms(data) 
update screen with new resulting image
